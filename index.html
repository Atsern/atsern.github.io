<h1>2. Add Items to make a Cake</h1>
<p>In the crafting menu, you should see a crafting area that is made up of a 3x3 crafting grid. To make a cake, place 3 milk, 2 sugar, 1 egg, and 3 wheat in the 3x3 crafting grid.

When making a cake, it is important that the items are placed in the exact pattern as the image below. In the first row, there should be 3 milk. In the second row, there should be 1 sugar in the first box, 1 egg in the second box, and 1 sugar in the third box. In the third row, there should be 3 wheat. This is the Minecraft crafting recipe for a cake.</p>

<p>Now that you have filled the crafting area with the correct pattern, the cake will appear in the box to the right.</p>

<h1>3. Move the Cake to Inventory</h1>
<p>Once you have crafted a cake, you need to move the new items to your inventory. You should also move your 3 empty buckets back to your inventory.</p>
